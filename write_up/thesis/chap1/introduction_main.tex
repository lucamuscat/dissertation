\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Problem Definition}

The act of writing and testing multiprocessor programs is, in jest,
oft-referred to as an art~\citep{herlihy2020art}, due to the difficulty of
ensuring the code's correctness. 
Due to the many ways to unknowingly cause
performance penalties or data corruption, intimate knowledge of the CPU's
architecture and memory is required. 

Within the realm of Computing Science, queues are among the data structures that
are utilized the most frequently. Since the development of multiprocessor
programming, concurrent queues have become an essential component of a wide
variety of concurrent and distributed algorithms.

\section{Aims and Objectives}

A number of concurrent queuing algorithms, together with a benchmarking
framework are implemented in this study. In addition to the validation of results, all
measurements taken are compared amongst each other and their original works.
Thus, our objectives are the following:

\begin{description}
\item[O1.] Implement a benchmarking framework for concurrent queueing
algorithms capable of gathering measurements similar to prior works;
\item[O2.] Reasonably validate the benchmarking framework through
metrics and experiments;
\item[O3.] Implement a variety of concurrent queueing algorithms, with the aim
of replicating results from the original works.
\item[O4.] Critically compare each concurrent queueing algorithm's performance
under a variety of synthetic benchmarks.
\end{description}
