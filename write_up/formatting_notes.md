### GPU Implementation of Arithmetic for Very Large Integers - Gerard Tabone
The table of contents is split into five:
1. Introduction - **Two Pages**
    1. Problem Definition
    2. Aims
> The aim of this project was to develop a parallel implementation for arithmetic
> operations of very large integers which could run on a GPU. A serial implementation
> which runs on the CPU already exists, such as the GNU Multiple Precision Library
> (GMP). GMP is a library for multiple precision arithmetic, which can operate on
> signed integers and its only limitation is the memory available. The objective is to
> get a parallel implementation which could outperform the serial implementation,
> thus allowing for efficient offloading of computations to the GPU
    3. Document Layout
2. Background and Literature Review - **15 Pages, includes diagrams**
3. Implementation - **Eight Pages**
4. Evaluation - **Six Pages**
5. Conclusion and Future Work - **Two Pages**

35 Pages, 24 references

   1. Aims and Objectives
> The main aims and objectives of this final year project are the following:
> 1. Create a lightweight framework exploiting strong code mobility
> 2. Execution using Load Balancing with both predefined and custom policies
> 3. Achieve external remote Execution with remote variable acquisition
   2. Structure
2. Background - **Three Pages**
   1. Language Selection Criteria
   2. Opting for JavaScript
3. Related Work - **Two Pages**
4. Architecture - **Six Pages**
5. Case Study - **17 Pages**
   1. Methodology
      1. Configuration of Framework
      2. Relevant Software Versions
      3. Relevant Machine Specifications
      4. Testing Automation
   2. .......
6. Conclusions

* *Language Selection Criteria* and *Opting for Javascript* may be adapted for my writeup; explicitly mentioning why C was chosen over other languages and runtimes.
* Explicitly mentions standard deviation in statistics.
* Evaluation consists of a dump of graphs and tables, followed by a single page description of all the results.
* I doubt that this dissertation got a good mark; the content was not well distributed across chapters and there were too many diagrams.
