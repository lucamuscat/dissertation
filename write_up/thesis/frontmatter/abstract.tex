\begin{abstract}
Queues are among the most ubiquitous data structures in the field of Computing
Science. With the advent of multiprocessor programming, concurrent queues are
at the core of many concurrent and distributed algorithms.

We were able to
identify few studies surveying and replicating concurrent queuing algorithms
from their seminal works. This work is an experimental study, with the aim of
comparing the performance of multiple concurrent queues with one another, under different levels
of contention, whilst replicating the results of other researchers. The
production of a benchmarking framework for concurrent queues also forms part of
this study's contributions. 

We successfully replicate results to support the
claims that non-blocking queues are superior to blocking ones under high
contention, and remain competitive under low contention. We also expose a
number of unreported, yet significant biases in a number of classical works. 

A limiting factor of this study is that each algorithm is benchmarked on
consumer-grade hardware, fortunately, the benchmarking framework is developed
to run on multiple machines, making this limitation transient in scope.
