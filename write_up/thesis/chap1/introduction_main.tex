\section{Aims and Objectives}

A number of concurrent queuing algorithms, together with a benchmarking
framework are implemented in this study. In addition to the validation of results, all
measurements taken are compared amongst each other and their original works.
Thus, our objectives are the following:

\begin{description}
\item[O1.] Implement a benchmarking framework for concurrent queueing
algorithms capable of gathering measurements similar to prior works;
\item[O2.] Reasonably validate the benchmarking framework through
metrics and experiments;
\item[O3.] Implement a variety of concurrent queueing algorithms, with the aim
of replicating results from the original works.
\item[O4.] Critically compare each concurrent queueing algorithm's performance
under a variety of synthetic benchmarks.
\end{description}
